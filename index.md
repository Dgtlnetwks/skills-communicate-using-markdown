# Communicate using Markdown
This is a test markdown file for the communication skills using markdown tutorial.

# This is a `<h1>` header, top level header
This paragraph starts wiht a top level header (similar to the `<h1>` header used in HTML pages.

## This is a `<h2>` header, second level header
Obviously we can add sub-headers to help organise our documentation.

### This is `<h3>`
Some text to demarcate the paragraphs.

#### This is `<h4>`
Even more text to demarcate the paragraphs.

##### This is `<h5>`
Some text to demarcate the paragraphs. We don't really want to go to 'Lorem ..'

###### This is `<h6>`, the lowest level supported
The very last sub-heading supported. **Don't go below this!!!**

####### This is a stupid attempt! `<h7>`

This is obviously a stupid attempt at going below the lowest level of heading supported.
<hr>
Can embed HTML code within markdown.

## Part 2: Add an image to the markdown file
In this part we will add an image to the markdown file using a statement similar to

 >`![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)`
 
and this should result in an image being displayed, as thus

![Image of Yaktocat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ed10dff-5549-453e-8cb8-7f46a04e61fd)

<hr>

## Part 3: Add a code example
Obviously when we are dealing with GitHub, we are going to be dealing with code and code snippets. Below are some examples of
adding code to documentation:

### Example 1
Markdown text
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```

### Eample 2
Same but with language support (JavaScript)
```javascript
var myVar = "Hello world!;
alert(myVar);
```

### Example 3
Python language
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```
