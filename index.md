# Test Markdown file for tutorial
This is a test markdown file for the communication skills using markdown tutorial.
# This is a `<h1>` header, top level header
This paragraph starts wiht a top level header (similar to the `<h1>` header used in HTML pages.

## This is a `<h2>` header, second level header
Obviously we can add sub-headers to help organise our documentation.

### This is `<h3>`
Some text to demarcate the paragraphs.

#### This is `<h4>`
Even more text to demarcate the paragraphs.

##### This is `<h5>`
Some text to demarcate the paragraphs. We don't really want to go to 'Lorem ..'

###### This is `<h6>`, the lowest level supported
The very last sub-heading supported. **Don't go below this!!!**

####### This is a stupid attempt! `<h7>`

This is obviously a stupid attempt at going below the lowest level of heading supported.
